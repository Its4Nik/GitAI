GitAi is a CLI tool that leverages AI to enhance your Git workflow. Generate commit messages, suggest semantic version bumps, create changelogs, and more - all powered by AI providers like Google Gemini, Ollama, and OpenAI.

## Features ‚ú®

- **AI-Generated Commit Messages**: Create meaningful commit messages from staged changes
- **Semantic Version Suggestions**: Get version bump recommendations (major/minor/patch)
- **Changelog Generation**: Automatically create detailed changelogs
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for Google Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI, and more
- **Diff Summary**: Create summaries of changes between 2 commits or tags.
- **Commit Templates**: Conventional Commits, Angular, Gitmoji, and custom formats
- **Debug Tools**: Track API usage and debug AI interactions

## Installation ‚ö°

```bash
# Install globally with Bun
bun add -g @its_4_nik/gitai
npm install -g @its_4_nik/gitai
yarn global add @its_4_nik/gitai

# Or run directly with:
bunx @its_4_nik/gitai
npx @its_4_nik/gitai
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

First, configure your AI providers:

```bash
gitai configure
```

Follow the interactive prompts to:
1. Select your default AI provider
2. Configure provider-specific settings (API keys, models)
3. Choose your preferred commit template
4. Set the max commits to analyze for version/changelog

Configuration is saved to `~/gitai.json` or your project directory `.gitai.json`

## Usage üöÄ

### Generate a Commit Message

```bash
# Stage your changes first
git add .

# Generate commit message
gitai commit

# Use a specific template
gitai commit --template gitmoji
```

### Suggest Version Bump

```bash
# Suggest semantic version bump based on recent commits
gitai version
```

### Generate Changelog

```bash
# Print changelog to console
gitai changelog

# Save changelog to file
gitai changelog --output CHANGELOG.md
```

### Create diff summary

```bash
# Print to console
gitai diff-summary HEAD v1.1.3
```

```
Diff Summary (HEAD ‚Üí v1.1.3):

The diff reveals several significant changes related to publishing, dependency management, and overall workflow. The `release-publish.yaml` workflow has been modified to remove permissions for `id-token`, simplify the version setting process by directly calling `npm version` without checking for existing tags, and transition to `bun publish` for publishing to npm using a `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. Additionally, the `bun.lock` file shows that the `ignore` package was removed, and several dependencies were updated including `camelcase` and `glob`. The `package.json` file had a version change to `1.0.14`, removed the repository URL, and had a minor update to typescript version dependencies.

Here's a short listing of changes:
*   `.github/workflows/release-publish.yaml`: Modified publishing workflow to use bun, and updated versioning logic.
*   `bun.lock`: Removed `ignore` package and updated a number of packages.
*   `package.json`: Version bump and repository url removal.

**Really short summary: The workflow transitions to using bun for publishing, updates dependencies, and removes repository URL.**

```bash
# Format as markdown
gitai diff-summary --markdown HEAD v1.1.3
```

## Diff Summary: HEAD ‚Üí v1.1.3

The changes between `HEAD` and `v1.1.3` involve modifications to the release publishing workflow and dependency updates.

Here's a summary of the key differences:

*   **Release Workflow:**
    *   The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release-publish.yaml`) had several modifications.
    *   The `permissions` block used for authentication was removed.
    *   The workflow no longer checks for the existence of a tag before executing `npm version`, instead always running `npm version "$TAG_NAME"`
    *   The workflow was updated to use bun to publish to npm.
*   **Dependency Updates:**
    *   The `bun.lock` file shows several dependency version updates, including `camelcase` and `glob`.
    *   The `ignore` dependency was removed from `bun.lock`

Short listing of changes:
* Removed permissions block from github workflow
* Changed publishing mechanism to use bun
* Upgraded many dependencies in bun.lock
* Removed ignore dependency
* Removed repository metadata

Breaking changes: None
